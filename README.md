# 🌎 Drought and Wildfires: Can California Keep Growing the World's Almonds?

&#x20;

## 📌 Overview

This project explores the impact of drought and wildfires on California's almond production. It integrates multiple datasets to analyze trends in drought severity, wildfire intensity, and almond acreage, yield, and prices.

## 📊 Data Sources

- **Wildfire Data**: Active fire records including Fire Radiative Power (FRP)
- **Drought Data**: Drought severity and affected regions
- **Almond Production Data**: Yield, production, and pricing trends

## 🔍 Analysis

The analysis was conducted using Jupyter Notebooks:

### 1️⃣ **Acreage Analysis** ([Notebook](./Acreage-analysis.ipynb))

- Examined almond-growing acreage over time
- Correlated acreage trends with drought severity

### 2️⃣ **Drought Analysis** ([Notebook](./drought.ipynb))

- Analyzed historical drought conditions in California
- Compared drought patterns with almond yield variations

### 3️⃣ **Wildfire Analysis** ([Notebook](./wildfire.ipynb))

- Evaluated wildfire frequency and intensity
- Assessed how wildfire-affected areas overlap with almond-growing regions

## 📈 Key Findings

✅ **Drought Severity & Almond Yield**: Severe drought years showed reduced almond yields despite increased acreage. ✅ **Wildfire Impact**: Proximity to wildfires significantly influenced yield losses and increased production costs. ✅ **Price Trends**: Prices fluctuated based on production levels and external market factors rather than just drought or wildfire severity.
